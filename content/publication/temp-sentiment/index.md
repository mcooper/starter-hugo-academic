abstract: Higher temperatures associated with climate change are expected to have major impacts on human mental health, and previous work has found strong associations between heat and mental well-being. However, these studies typically use data reported at the city or county level, and, to date, have found no difference in vulnerability based on income or race.  We therefore use expressed mood in a quarter of a billion geolocated tweets as a proxy for mental health status available at fine spatial and temporal scales, and find stark differences in the effects of heat depending on neighborhood characteristics. Here we show that increased temperatures worsen expressed mood in all areas, but that this effect is much stronger in poor and Black neighborhoods. We also find that the effect of heat on expressed mood is greatest in the early morning, supporting the hypothesis that heat affects mental health through a sleep quality pathway. This paper presents the first evidence of neighborhood heterogeneity in the vulnerability of mental health to heat.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: We use geolocated child nutrition data from 53 developing countries to show that minor to severe droughts as well as severe periods of extreme rainfall are related to child stunting. We then explore how various geographic factors mitigate or amplify the effect of drought on child heights. Finally, we combine global data on these factors to map where child stunting is currently vulnerable to drought, finding that arid low-income countries with poor governance and political instability are where drought could have the largest effect on child stunting.
